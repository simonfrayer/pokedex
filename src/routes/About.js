        <h1>About this Pokedex</h1>
        <span>In this project, I am building a Pokedex using JavaScript, React, asynchronous programming, and API calls from PokeAPI. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that displays information about different Pokemon in real-time, such as their names, types, and images.</span>
       <span>To retrieve the data, I am using asynchronous API calls with the fetch() method in React. This allows for the data to be fetched without interrupting the user interface. I am also utilizing React to create reusable components that display the data in a clear and organized manner.

</span>
       <span>As I work on the project, I am improving my understanding of JavaScript, React, asynchronous programming, and API calls. By using PokeAPI, I am learning how to retrieve and display data from an external API, which is a fundamental skill for web development.
